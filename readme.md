OO - compose applications of objects that interract to deliver behaviors.<br>


Challenges of OOP in Go

    - is not a class and object language.
    - Go does not have private data.
    - Go does not support inheritance.
    - Go does not have abstract base types.

Encapsulation - Accessing a service on an object without knowing how that service is implemented.

Strategies of encapsulation in Go<br>

    - Package oriented design
    - Interfaces

Message Passing - Sending a message to an object, but letting that object determine what to do with it.<br>
Strategies

    - Interfaces
    - Channels

Composition - Behavior resuse strategy where a type contains objects that have desired fucntionality/ The type delegates calls to thos objects to use their behaviors.<br>
Strategy

    - type Embedding

Polymorphism - The ability to transaparently substitue a family of types that implement a common set of behaviors.
